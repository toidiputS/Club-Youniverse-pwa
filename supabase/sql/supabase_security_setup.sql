-- Security Setup for Club Youniverse Supabase Project (ktfezfnkghtwbkmhxdyd)

-- 1. Enable RLS on broadcasts table
ALTER TABLE public.broadcasts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Add policies for broadcasts
-- Everyone can read the current broadcast
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to broadcasts" ON public.broadcasts;
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to broadcasts"
ON public.broadcasts FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (true);

-- Only authenticated users can update (or refine this to specific leader logic)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated update to broadcasts" ON public.broadcasts;
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated update to broadcasts"
ON public.broadcasts FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- 3. Fix box_slots policies
-- If it has RLS enabled but no policies, it's currently locked.
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to box_slots" ON public.box_slots;
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to box_slots"
ON public.box_slots FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (true);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated update to box_slots" ON public.box_slots;
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated update to box_slots"
ON public.box_slots FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (true);

-- 4. Fix Function Search Path (set_updated_at)
-- This prevents search_path attacks.
ALTER FUNCTION public.set_updated_at() SET search_path = public;

-- 5. Enable RLS on playback_state (if exists)
