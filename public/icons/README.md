# Creating App Icons

**IMPORTANT:** You need to add 2 icon files to complete the PWA setup:

## Required Files:
```
/public/icons/icon-192.png  (192x192 pixels)
/public/icons/icon-512.png  (512x512 pixels)
```

## How to Create:

### Option 1: Use Online Generator
1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Create a design with:
   - Background: Dark (#020617)
   - Text/Shape: Golden (#facc15)
   - Symbol: Radio waves or "CY"
3. Download and rename to `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`
4. Place in `public/icons/` folder

### Option 2: Design Your Own
Use Canva, Figma, or Photoshop:
- Canvas: 512x512px
- Background: Dark gradient (#020617)
- Icon: Golden radio symbol (#facc15)
- Export as PNG
- Resize a copy to 192x192px

### Option 3: Temporary Placeholder
For testing, you can use any square logo/image:
- Just resize to 192x192 and 512x512
- Place in `/public/icons/`
- Replace with proper design later

Once icons are added, the PWA will be fully functional!
